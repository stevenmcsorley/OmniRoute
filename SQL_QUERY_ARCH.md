- Buses: The `CompanyId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Companies` table, indicating the company that owns the bus.

- Routes: The `BusId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Buses` table, indicating the bus that operates the route. Additionally, we can introduce a new column `CompanyId` in the `Routes` table to establish a direct association with the company that operates the route.

- Workers: The `CompanyId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Companies` table, indicating the company that employs the worker.

- Tickets: The `WorkerId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Workers` table, indicating the worker who holds the ticket. The `RouteId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Routes` table, indicating the route associated with the ticket.

- Drivers: The `CompanyId` column establishes a foreign key relationship with the `Companies` table, indicating the company that employs the driver. Additionally, we can introduce a new column `RouteId` in the `Drivers` table to establish a direct association with the route the driver is assigned to.

With these modifications, the associations are as follows:

- Buses are associated with a company.
- Routes are associated with a bus and a company.
- Workers are associated with a company.
- Tickets are associated with a worker and a route.
- Drivers are associated with a company and a route.
- Passengers are associated with a route, a worker, a ticket, a driver, and a company.

These associations ensure that the relationships between the entities are accurate and reflect the intended functionality of the transportation system.

here are some SQL queries that you can perform to test the associations:

Retrieve all buses and their associated company:

```sql 
SELECT b.Id AS BusId, b.LicensePlate, b.Capacity, c.Id AS CompanyId, c.Name AS CompanyName
FROM Buses b
JOIN Companies c ON b.CompanyId = c.Id;
```

SELECT b.Id AS BusId, b.LicensePlate, b.Capacity, c.Id AS CompanyId, c.Name AS CompanyName
FROM Buses b
JOIN Companies c ON b.CompanyId = c.Id
