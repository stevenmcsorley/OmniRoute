QR Code Retrieval

Assigned Routes and Passengers

GET /api/driver/routes?driverId={driverId}: Get a list of routes assigned to the driver's company and display them in the app.
GET /api/driver/passengers?routeId={routeId}: Get a list of passengers who have booked tickets for the selected route. Display their information in the app, including their boarding status.
Passenger Onboarding

POST /api/driver/scan-qr-code: Scan the QR code from the passenger's ticket. This endpoint validates the QR code, updates the passenger's boarding status to "Onboarded," and returns the updated passenger list for the route.
By implementing these endpoints and functionality, the worker can log in to the passenger app using their unique ID, view available routes associated with their company, book tickets for a route, and retrieve their QR code. The driver can log in to the driver app using their driver ID, view their assigned routes for the company they are associated with, see the list of passengers for each route, and onboard passengers by scanning their QR codes. The passenger app and driver app can communicate with the backend API to retrieve and update data as necessary.
